Step 1- Install JDK 8
        A- Run the following commands in terminal to install it from PPA.
        
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install java-common oracle-java8-installer
          
           (During the installation you will need to accept the Orancle License Agreement) 
        B- To make sure, installation was successful, open the terminal and run the following command.
            
            javac -version
            
           If you get a java version back, the installation was successful.
        C- After installation, you'll need to set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
            1- In the terminal, type the following command.
           
                sudo su
                
            2- Next, identify where java is installed using the following command.
            
                which java
                
            3- Now to set the JAVA_HOME globally, we edit the bash.bashrc file. To do so, run the following command.
            
                gedit .bashrc
                
            4- A new file will open. At the end of this file, type the following, one line at a time.
                
                JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/bin                
                export JAVA_HOME 
                PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME
                export PATH
                
Step 2- Install Ubuntu make from PPA. Run the following commands to accomplish that.
        
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make
            sudo apt update 
            sudo apt install ubuntu-make
            
Step 3- Install Android Studio using Ubuntu make.
            
            umake android --accept-license
            
        Ubuntu make will download and install all the required components.
