# Android-Studio-installation
This repository is for Linux beginners and guides you through the step by step process to install Android Studio on Elementary OS (and Ubuntu) using two methods:
* PPA (works on both Ubuntu and Elementary OS)  and
* Ubuntu make (works on Ubuntu only). 

Note- After installation, when you open Android Studio for the first time, in the menu bar click on "Tools" and then hit "Create Desktop Entry.." to create a start menu icon which you can use to access Android Studio.
